Performance: Combine ensures efficient and responsive network handling.

Readability: Clear separation of concerns ensures readable and maintainable code.

Maintainability: Using protocols allows easy swapping of service implementations.

Testability: Mocks and protocols help decouple networking from tests.

Scalability and Simplicity: The MVVM pattern scales easily, while keeping the code simple.

**MVVM**: 


Model: Productmodel defines the data structure matching the JSON response.
ViewModel: ProductViewModel handles fetching the data from the API, managing state (isLoading, errorMessage, etc.), and exposing the products list to the view.
View: ContentView shows the UI for displaying the list of products.
